# Single Cell for Cell Line 
- First goal is to see if single cell could explain the phenomena that is being witnessed in wet lab cell line experiments. 
- Second is to use the data from single cell to drive hypotheses. 

Had some issues with it being too "perfect" so I played it the parameters and compared the groups with the heatmaps 

Using Cell Ranger (scRNAseq was 10X) and Seurat
This is for OV90 Cell line
